# Help-Gesture-Detection-with-Alarm-System
This Python program uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect a specific hand gesture (representing a "Help" signal) through the webcam. When the gesture is detected, the program plays an alarm sound and overlays a red alert on the screen with the text “HELP NEEDED”.
